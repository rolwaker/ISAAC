# ISAAC
ISAAC is a random number generator originally made by Bob Jenkins and released
into the public domain. If you want to download the original source you can
find them [here](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaacafa.html).

This is a direct port of that random number generator and produces identical
output, although it is in C++ (and rather more readable if you ask me).

I also release this code into the public domain for you to do with as you
please. Mostly because demanding credit for porting someone else's code seems
more than a bit unfair.
